# COMPACT
Technique for Extrapolating Particle Compaction Profiles from collected X-ray Tomography Datasets 

*This project is not currently supported by Idaho National Laboratory as production grade software but is being made available to the public. Please use at your own risk.*

The code extrapolates the nearest neighbor particle spacing and sizing from collected X-ray images. The profiles are directly interpretable for 
non-destructive imaging of large imaging datasets that span the micron to millimeter size scale. 

Users must have the image processing Matlab toolbox installed.  Obtain at: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
